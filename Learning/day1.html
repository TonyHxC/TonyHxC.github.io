HTML5 Mobile App Development – Day 1

Starting Points
Mobile apps and mobile devices are becoming more and more important everyday
 People naturally expect your website to work on your mobile device with no issues
 People expect you to have an app for your company or part of your company. it could be an internal or  external facing app
your customers and internal staff witl expect thier devices will be able to use the full functionality of the app 
Everybody is on the mobile 'bandwagon'
Customers will approach you asking for a mobile strategy
If you do not have a mobile strategy your website/app/company is going to get left behind very quickly
there are three main platforms ios, android and windows
There is no good solution currently to build an app for all 3 platforms.
You use HTML5 because you dont want to learn each major platform and require specific developers for each

Current state of native affairs
Platform
IDE
Language
IOS
Xcode
Objective-C
Android
Eclipse
Java
Windows Phone
Visual Studio
C# or VB.NET

Are you giving the user something they Need/Want and Use?
Provide your user an experience they will be happy with

Mobile Browsers important features released in last few years
Meta tags to tell a mobile browser not to scale site down
New standards that make building sites that work in multiple browsers easier
new standards allow sites to act like applications




HTML5 
New Tags

Video
Audio
nav
section
canvas (raw pixel drawing)
Better support for svg (declarative drawing)

Not all features are available on all browsers but generally most important ones are
local storage – allows for offline experience
geolocation – applications that respond to where a user is physically at

Website that tells you what you can do in each browser – http://caniuse.com/


CSS3
Transforms – 2d/3d
Transitions
rgba color values
lots of other feature

MEDIA QUERIES 
use it to target different resolutions, landscape/potrait and have that info all contained the application
a CSS expression that can evaluate to true or false
if true the css selectors and properties inside the expression will be applied
make it possible to build a single site/app that can scale up and down with devices
Execute during the lifetime of the page not just when it initially loads





Native with WebBrowser
all of the major platforms have a component or control that can load HTML. On Windows Phone 7, that's called the WebBrowser control, on iOS it's the UIWebView, and on Android it's called just the WebView.
All of them accomplish the same thing. It allows you to create a native application in each of those platforms to add the component or control or view, have it display even full screen if you'd like to. 

Refer to this as 'Web View'

Use as much HTML5 and CSS as possible while using Native Functionality to support those needs


Pivot

Choice
Pros
Cons
Responsive Website
* No Deployment
* No need to join/pay for developer programs
* Not a true “app” experience
* No integration with device hardware
“Add to home screen” responsive web site
* App-like experience
* Can avoid sharing in-app purchase revenue
* No integration with device hardware
Native app using WebBroser “control”
*Full access to hardware
* Must join developer programs
* must share in-app purchase revenue
* Must build native app for Web Browser “Control”

Third Party tool options
PhoneGap and appMobi
HTML5 Frameworks that compile down to native shels using “Web View” approach
MonoTouch
Not HTML5 specific but a way to build iOS/Android native applications using C#

Tips
Using EM  for font size is a good idea when developing for different devices as it allows for responsive font (ex: font-size: 2em;)
